First and foremost I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Tristan Glatard , who has supported me throughout my thesis with his motivating words, patience and knowledge. I consider myself so lucky to have such an exceptional and friendly supervisor.
Many thanks to my friends and family who have always been cheering me up and for being there for me. With a special mention to all the BIN Lab members and MCIN team, you guys have always been fun to work with. Special thanks to Val\'erie, Soudabeh and Ali, you guys have been wonderful labmates. ``TOM" family, for all the love and support, can't thank them enough !
