\section{Reproducibility}
\begin{itemize}
 \item A multi-modal parcellation of human cerebral cortex.

\paragraph{The lack of computational reproducibility threatens data science in several domains \cite{Gla15}.
We aim at 
\\ (1) quantifying the effect of operating system version updates on biological results and 
\\ (2) identifying the software tools in a pipeline that are responsible for this effect. 
We focus on the pre-processing of data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) \cite{Gla13}.}
